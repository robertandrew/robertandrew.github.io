Actions on load:
⦁	All data manipulation
⦁	All drawing, based on default dates set by the setDefaults() function
Actions on click:
⦁	If it's a radio button...
⦁	Draw all, based on the three radio-button presets for each
⦁	If it's a rectangular listener...
⦁	Draw only the breakdown
Actions on mouseover:
⦁	Display tooltip, remove tooltip
Actions on resize:
⦁	Redraw all
⦁	Trigger mobile draw settings at 350 px wide
Possible discrete actions:
⦁	FIX DATA
⦁	Pivot data
⦁	Sort data
⦁	Filter data
⦁	DRAW
⦁	Draw canvas
⦁	Add hed/dek
⦁	Draw overall
⦁	Draw breakdown
Mobile-only settings:
⦁	Time period automatically reduced to "since the recovery"
⦁	Radio buttons for time period eliminated
⦁	Layout of the breakdown shifts into the wacky one-column
Data is all handled upon initial page load. At that time, we...
⦁	Add value, opacity factors and ranks for...
⦁	Percentage change
⦁	Absolute change
⦁	Sector size
⦁	EXCEPTION: Ups and downs are calculated as part of the DrawOverall function, because they are  time-period dependent
Draw functions need to...
⦁	Filter the data
⦁	Set X and Y scales based on the data, x scale for overall depends on the length of the dataset
⦁	Draw the data
⦁	Draw listeners to later manipulate the data
⦁	Draw tooltips on mouseover
Data functions need to...
⦁	Pivot all the data into one stripe
⦁	Nest everything
⦁	Rank the data based on time
⦁	
Best ways to accomplish this:
⦁	Go through my data loading process step by step and write out what I am tryiing to accomplish with each.
⦁	Define broad functions, but only worry about the discrete actions as I write them
⦁	Nonetheless, constantly ask myself if this is the tightest discrete function possible and if it ever needs to be replicated.
